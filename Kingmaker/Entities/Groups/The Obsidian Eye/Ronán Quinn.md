Member and de facto leader of [[The Obsidian Eye]], a party formed by [[Lady Jamandi Aldori]] under [[The Charter]]. Second son of [[Conláed Quinn]], brother of [[Duinn Quinn]] and [[Róisín Quinn]] and heir apparent to [[House Quinn]].
## History
[[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] grew up being raised by the members of his father's household, and occasionally also by his father, due to his mother's death during his birth. He grew to have a strong sense of community, and little sense of justice, but still a clear personal concept of right and wrong.

After his brother [[Duinn Quinn|Duinn]]'s disinheritance, he was expected to become the leader of [[House Quinn]] were his father [[Conláed Quinn|Conláed]] to pass away but eschewed that claim, not wanting to carry the title of [[Conláed Quinn|The Shield of the Realm]] due to the way that it was expected of The Shield to fight unfairly and make no concessions in aide of the throne's self interest regardless of any truth in the cause was being crushed. 

Leaving a note in support of his sister's unwanted claim to [[House Quinn]], he abandoned his parents, siblings and ancestral home in search of a life more befitting of his disinterest in a societal sense of honour he found hypocritical, and became (for a time) a "free mercenary" (i.e. a sell-sword without a guild). For this time, he went by [[Ronán Quinn|The Red Blade]], and was [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] to his few friends amongst the free mercenaries. 

After leading a few rag-tag team jobs, he found that his fame drew the attention of [[House Quinn]] when [[Conláed Quinn|Conláed]] sent him a letter asking him to come home and finish his training as a knight in order to take the mantle of lord of the house, and bringing news of his sister [[Róisín Quinn|Róisín]]'s ill health. Ignoring the letter and hoping to evade a more formal summons and shake off the debt of gold and favours owed to grislier fellow mercenaries from dirty jobs, he heeded the summons to [[The Feast at Aldori Manor]].
## Relationships
[[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] kept company with [[Thaeden Evergreen]] for some time before [[The Feast at Aldori Manor]], and tends to seek his council when possible about religious and magical matters - calling him the "Staff Sorcerer" after the [[Opening the Eye|formation of the Obsidian Eye]].

Additionally, he took emotional support from [[Victor|V]] after [[False Haven|the events]] beneath [[Fort Serenko]].
