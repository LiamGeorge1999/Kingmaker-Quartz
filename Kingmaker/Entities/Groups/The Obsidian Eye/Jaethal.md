An undead cleric who worshipped the goddess [[Urgathoa]], and a founding member of [[The Obsidian Eye]]. Wields a large scythe.

## Personality
[[Jaethal|Jaethal]] seems defensive of her religion, and is quick to take offence about it - but keeps her feelings to herself, and so withdraws from clumsy conversation. Despite these withdrawn characteristics, she's loyal to anyone who treats her with sufficient respect.

## Death
Died in the raid on the [[Thorn River Bandit Hideout]].
