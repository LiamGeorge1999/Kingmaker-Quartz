(CON-layd Kwin) Widowered husband of the late [[Áine Fionnúir-Quinn (Deceased)]], husband and once-brother-in-law of [[Gráinne Fionnúir-Quinn]], father of [[Duinn Quinn]], [[Ronán Quinn]], and [[Róisín Quinn]]. and head of [[House Quinn]]. Famously unlikable, but also a famously effective strategist and battlefield and siege tactician. Holds the right to name his successor, typically used hereditarily to name the oldest son, by an ancient and anachronistic tradition.

Credited for winning a number of key battles (most notably quelling a small but growing rebellion), dreaded on the battlefield, and a raving disciplinarian. Disgraced by the black mark set upon his record by the behaviour that led to his first son [[Duinn Quinn|Duinn]]'s disinheritance as well as his second son [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]]'s abandoning his house, and further disgraced by the same's refusal to give up the family name.

Posthumously divorced [[Áine Fionnúir-Quinn (Deceased)]] (the mother of [[Duinn Quinn|Duinn]] and [[Ronán Quinn]]) in order to lawfully marry her sister [[Gráinne Fionnúir-Quinn]] (the mother of [[Róisín Quinn]]).

Used his daughter [[Róisín Quinn|Róisín]]'s temporary sickness in an attempt to convince his second son [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] to return home and take on the mantle of head of [[House Quinn]], having disinherited his first son [[Duinn Quinn|Duinn]] and tradition dictating that the position go to a male heir.
