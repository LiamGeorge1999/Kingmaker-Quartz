The noble house from which [[Conláed Quinn]], his daughter [[Róisín Quinn]] and his son [[Ronán Quinn]] hail.

By ancient tradition in order to honor of the deal that granted [[House Quinn]] noble status, the head of [[House Quinn]] is to be a sworn knight of the royal family. If a head of [[House Quinn]] is to be appointed and refuse or forsake the knighthood, the house would fall from noble status.

Traditionally led by the first son of the previous leader, typically brought up to be a skilled fighter and shrewd tactician in order to be an effective knight for the realm.
