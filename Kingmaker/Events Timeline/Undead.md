In the wake of that victory, [[Victor|V]] receives a letter indicating that he could find his other self by returning to [[Navatka's Crossing]], and resolves to leave before his departure feast.

Leaving [[Lindzi]] to recover, [[Ron치n Quinn|Ron치n]], [[Thaeden Evergreen|Thaeden]] and [[Jaethal]] depart to raid the camp of the [[Thorn River Bandits]], intending to remove the threat to [[Oleg's Trading Post|Oleg's Post]] completely so they could later establish it as the economic centre of an early kingdom established via [[The Charter]] by [[The Obsidian Eye|The Eye]].

In the woods, they encounter [[Septus Valron]] who is convinced to aide the party in the counter-raid, and they encounter a cleric at a temple in the forest who intends to accompany them too.

The raid on the camp is ultimately successful and results in the deaths of all the bandits present, but [[Jaethal]] dies in [[Ron치n Quinn|Ron치n]]'s arms - arguably due to his mismanagement of the battle.
