Having escaped the undercroft beneath [[Fort Serenko]], the party moved out and made camp for the night. [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]], clearly still unsteady after his close shaves with death, was councilled by [[Victor|V]] for some time after the others took their leave to sleep, and the two disturbed Lindzi who was trying to sleep off exhaustion and reacted with angry words.

[[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]], feeling a need to cathart and little room in which to do it, wandered into the woods to be alone, leaving [[Victor|V]] with a thankful glance. [[Victor|V]] sent his familiar [[Pride]] to keep an eye on [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]], but the latter evaded his detail.

[[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] regrouped with the party the following morning, taking Lindzi's choice of travelling song from his home country as an olive branch but marching under a storm cloud nonetheless.

The next night when making camp, the party were assailed by a giant spider, and resulting from an ill-planned attempt at trickery, Lindzi was bitten and tied up in webbing, but quickly rescued by the party, who then arrived at [[Oleg's Trading Post|Oleg's Post]] the next day.
