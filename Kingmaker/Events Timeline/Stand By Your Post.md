[[The Obsidian Eye|The Eye]] plan the defense of [[Oleg's Trading Post]] from a group of the [[Thorn River Bandits]] who run a frequent and well-rehearsed extortion racket on [[Oleg]] and [[Svetlana]]. Though successful, the plan is set askew by the sudden realization that [[Lindzi]] is sick from a bite from the [[Flies and Webs|giant spider]].

After repelling the attack, [[Thaeden Evergreen|Thaeden]] and [[Victor|V]] set out to meet a druidic hermit known to live nearby in search of a cure for the poison, and in the process have a pair of horses they borrowed from Oleg stolen. They gather the necessaries for the hermit and return ahead of him, while [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] interrogates a dying prisoner from the bandit attack to gain information about the [[Thorn River Bandits]]' hideout, and receives a letter intended for [[Victor|V]] delivered by the guard who was in charge of security on the night of [[The Aldori Manor Raid]], saying that he's been demoted, and that he and his three colleagues were sent to aide [[The Obsidian Eye|The Eye]] in the defense of their impending settlement.
