During the night, the manor was raided by bandits in a co-ordinated attack led by Valomira that quickly overwhelmed the manor guards. [[Ron√°n Quinn|Ronan]] and [[Thaeden Evergreen|Thaeden]] began to fight them off, eventually encountering [[Victor|V]], who began to assist them.
They found a charter logging the payment due to the various guards on duty that night and used it to conclude that the invasion was aided by plants in the [[Aldori Manor]] guard, helping route out the last one.

In a bid to rescue their new friends and potential sponsor, the trio reclaimed the west wing, helping [[Lady Jamandi Aldori|Lady Aldori]] fend off the attack.

Having cleared the threat, they retreated with [[Lindzi]] and [[Jaethal]] to an inn to calm their nerves.
