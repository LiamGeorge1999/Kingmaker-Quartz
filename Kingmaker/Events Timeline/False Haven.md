Arriving at [[Fort Serenko]], [[The Obsidian Eye]] were shocked to find it in ruins. After some investigation involving [[Jaethal|Jaethal]] using magic to interrogate the dead, they found that a plague had spread and zombified the soldiers, apparently having started in a cave under the fort. The survivors had locked themselves inside after burning many of the dead.

While [[Victor|V]] and [[Thaeden Evergreen|Thaeden]] insisted on going into the cave to stop the plague at it's source, and [[Jaethal|Jaethal]] was willing to go in too, [[Lindzi]] was told to stay topside and [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] thought it was a senseless risk. Eventually [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] agreed to follow the others into the cave, where he would nearly die on several occasions.

As the party explored the cave, they dispatched several of the undead and found a false/tainted shrine to [[Jaethal|Jaethal]]'s goddess [[Urgathoa]]. They continued and found a summoning room, where a large grafted beast appeared from a cauldron and attacked them.

After defeating the beast, [[Victor|V]] decided to demolish the cave - but having been downed and near death during the fight, [[Ronán Quinn|Ronán]] lagged behind the party as they ran to escape from the collapsing cavern. Seeing [[Jaethal|Jaethal]] nearly get crushed, he snapped into action and pushed her to safety, barely avoiding that same fate himself, and the away party made it out without losses.

Emerging to the surface, the other members of [[The Obsidian Eye]] found [[Lindzi]] exhausted, having fought off a horde of no fewer than sixteen bandits by herself.
